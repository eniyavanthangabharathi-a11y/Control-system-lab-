Week 1 – Mass–Spring–Damper (Open Loop)

System:
Linear mass–spring–damper system modeled using second-order dynamics.

Objective:
Study open-loop response and understand the effect of damping.

Tasks:
- Derive transfer function
- Simulate step response
- Compare underdamped, critically damped, overdamped cases

Status:
Modeling not started
