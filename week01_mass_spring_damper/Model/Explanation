#System Description

This project analyzes the dynamic behavior of a mass-spring-damper system using MATLAB and Simulink.
A single physical plant model is developed and reused across all simulations to ensure consistent and
meaningful comparison between different control configurations.

The system parameters are fixed for all experiments:
- Mass: m = 2 kg
- Spring stiffness: k = 4 N/m
- Damping coefficient: c = 2 N·s/m

# Simulation Scenarios
The same plant model is evaluated under the following conditions:

1. Open-loop system response
2. Closed-loop system with unity feedback
3. Open-loop system with external disturbance input
4. Closed-loop system with external disturbance input
5. Closed-loop system with integral control for steady-state error elimination
   and improved disturbance rejection

This structured progression highlights the role of feedback and integral action in shaping system dynamics.
