## State Feedback Observation

Increasing state feedback gains shifts closed-loop poles further left,
resulting in faster system response.

Mild feedback improves response speed with limited overshoot, while
strong feedback produces a much faster response but at the cost of
higher control effort and potential sensitivity.

This demonstrates the trade-off between performance and robustness
in state-feedback control design.
