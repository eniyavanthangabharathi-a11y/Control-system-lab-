## Time-Domain Performance Interpretation

The step response characteristics are directly influenced by the
physical parameters of the mass–spring–damper system.

- Mass (m): Higher mass increases inertia, leading to slower rise time.
- Damping (c): Damping controls overshoot and settling time.
  Low damping results in oscillations and higher overshoot.
- Spring constant (k): Higher stiffness increases natural frequency,
  resulting in faster response but potentially higher overshoot.

These results show how physical system parameters map directly to
time-domain performance metrics in state-space models.
